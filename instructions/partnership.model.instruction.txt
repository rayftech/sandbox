Enhanced Partnership Status Flow
The partnership lifecycle should include these statuses in sequence:

PENDING: Initial state when a partnership request is created
APPROVED: When the recipient accepts the partnership request
REJECTED: When the recipient declines the partnership request
CANCELED: When the requester cancels their request before a response
UPCOMING: When approved but the start date hasn't been reached
ONGOING: When approved and currently between start and end dates
COMPLETE: When the partnership has finished successfully

Partnership Model Implementation Details
To implement the partnership model based on your existing codebase, I'd create these files:
1. Create src/models/partnership.model.ts
This model should include:

Core Identifiers:

MongoDB ObjectId
Reference to Course ID
Reference to Project ID
Requester user ID
Recipient user ID


Status Management:

Partnership status (enum with all states)
Request timestamp
Response timestamp
Completion timestamp
Lifecycle status (upcoming/ongoing/complete)


Communication Fields:

Request message
Response message
Messages array for ongoing communication


Analytics Fields:

Time dimensions (year, quarter, month)
Approval time in days
Partnership duration in days
Success metrics


Methods:

Status transition validation
Lifecycle status calculation based on dates
Time analytics calculation
